## Features
- Users can order one or more pizzas from a menu.

- Placing an order requires the user's name, phone number, and address.
- Optionally, GPS location can be provided to make delivery easier.
- Users can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price.
- Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API.
